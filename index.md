    about

</h3>

My name is Temi, and I'm a PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems biology ([GGSB](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}) program at the University of Chicago. Prior to this, I completed a master's at the University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome [Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/){:target="_blank"}.

In Fall 2022, I joined [Haky's lab](https://hakyimlab.org/){:target="_blank"} for my PhD thesis. Here, I will be using computation, statistics and whatever means necessary (no kidding) to understand genetic data in relation to phenotypes. Specifically, I will be studying variations in the human epigenome (at the genomic level and the population level), how these variations influence molecular-level activities (e.g. TF binding), and how these, in turn, influence complex traits and diseases. These are complex questions. Wish me luck!

Here is my <a href="../docs/cv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cv</a> and a list of <a href="../publications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publications</a> that I have contributed to.
